    <h1> About Me </h1>

<p>Hi my name is Gnik Sivart. I have a beautiful wife and two wonderful kids. I am a mechanical engineer who enjoys learning about Reliability, Cryptocurrency, and how to not mess up DIY jobs.</p>

<p>I grew up in a small town in South East Texas where I spent most of my time playing Halo, Call of Duty, Warcraft 3, and Runescape with my friends and brothers.
    I also spent most of the year playing either league or school soccer as well as playing the Alto Saxophone in the school band.
    Most of my summers were spent either volunteering for a kids camp off of Lake San Rayburn or working at my churches summer camp.

<p>I ended up getting a decent scholarship to McNeese State University and earned a Bachelors in Mechanical Engineering from the College and a Minor in Mathematics.
    While in college I spent what little free time I had chasing snakes and alligators, as well as playing ultimate frisbee, an world of warcraft, halo, and league of legends.
    I was able to get one summer internship with Citgo and got to fly a payload to the edge of space with the LA-ACES proejct as well as participate in some ASME events as well.
    </p>

<p>I graduated from college in the Spring of 2009 right after the great financial crisis, which was pretty much awesome.
   I got to move back in with my parents and everything before I landed my first "real" job with INVISTA down in South Texas.
   While working there I got to learn about Charles Koch and Market Based Management, cut my teeth as an engineer, and get really familiar with the maintenance work process as a Gatekeeper of sorts.
   </p>

<p> While working at INVISTA I met my now wife and moved to North West Indiana and managed to only wreck two cars while I was there.
    We also ended up getting married while we lived there and welcomed my handsome son and beautiful daugheter to the world.
    I got to work in a Hot Strip Mill as a Maintenance and Technology Engineer while I was there working on improvements and managing some union millwrights.
    While there, we also bought our "forever home" which was a 1950s home that had hardly been updated and decided we could remodel the entire home.
    and after about 5 years when my wife and I started to not enjoy the gloomy cold weather anymore, we decided to move somewhere warmer.
    </p>

<p>That's when I got my current job in SW Lousiana working for SASOL as a fixed equipment engineer specializing in bolted flange joints and studying ASME-PCC1.
   After about a year or two of updating the procedures and working on developing a torque database, I was moved to a Reliability Engineer and Lead.
   There I quickly learned the importance of being or trying to become a great leader, the importance of documentation, and what managers actually spend all their time doing all day.
   All the while we got to remodel what we now refer to lovingly as our "hurricane home" after the strongest hurricane on record (Laura) hit SW Lousiana in 2020, which we recently moved back into.
