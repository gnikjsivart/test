<h1>Hello World</h1>
   <p style="color:red;">My name is Gnik Sivart and this is my website. 
    I say this is my website as I'm trying to code all of it from the ground up.
    Yes, I'm a little crazy and yes, I know there are already default layouts I can use, 
    but I want this to be a journey and those wanting to learn how to create their own website or project to come along and be encouraged and be able to grow together. 
    </p>

  <p style="color:orange;"> I plan to use this website to share my knowledge on Mechanical and Reliability Engineering in a plant environment
    What it's like to be a leader and/or manager in that atmosphere as well.
    I play to share some of the many DIY projects that my wife and I have taken on both recently as well as not so recently
    as well as detailing my journey of learning to code and building my website from the ground up.
   </p>

<h2>Engineering and Leadership</h2>
   <p style="color:gold;">I've been a Mechanical Engineer for almost 15 years and want to try and share some of that knowledge with new engineers or those who maybe interested in Engineering.
    The background of the information I'll share is mostly related to either Chemicals or Steel Manufacturing.
    I'll also be sharing some of the infomration I learned during my short time as a manager as well as how to be a more effective leader trying to drive cultural change.
   </p>

<h2>DIY Projects and Tools</h2>
   <p style="color:green;">My wife and I spent some time remodeling a mostly orignial home from the 1950s as well as rebuilding a brand new home that was gutted after Hurricane Laura
    I'll also be sharing about some of the tools we used or bought to complete those projects as well as provide some review and commentary on some tools I own or hope to buy one day.
    </p>

<h2>Learning to Code and Building a Website</h2>
   <p style="color:blue;">Finally I hope to share some of my challenges of learning to build a website from the ground up as well as having mostly no code experience.
    If you stop by and see some strange fonts, colors, or something that doesn't look like it's working correctly, I plan on building in real time so you can follow along with my sucesses and failures.
    I also plan on trying to build a basic RPG type browser game as well that I'm hoping will improve and grow over time, but will start off very basic.
   </p>

   <p style="color:indigo;">At any point during this process feel free to leave feedback and send me an X/Twitter DM, which will probably be the best way to contact me.
    You can also send me an email to the address at the bottom of ever page, or if you're lazy like me to tklounge@gmail.com.
    Any tips or tricks are appreciated in helping me improve my code/website and remember.
    This site wasn't built in a day. Go start building that project you've always wanted to start and share it so others can learn and be motivated as well. 
   </p>

   <p style="color:violet;">This is a test message to see if the experiment can work.</p>
